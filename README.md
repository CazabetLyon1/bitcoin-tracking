# Bitcoin users re-identification using community detection

## About

Algorithm allowing the re-identification of Bitcoin users from heuristics based on the blockchain transaction history.

## Usage

1. Install python dependencies from requirements file

    ```shell
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Setup [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html), an instance will be launched by the PySpark executor

3. Setup [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/), the 
[Neo4j Graph Algorithms plugin](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms) and 
[APOC Procedures plugin](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures) and 
launch an instance of it

4. Create a config files in `/app` in the following format :

     - `databaseconfig.py` : PySpark and Neo4j databases configurations
     ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    pyspark = {
        'hdfs_path': '/path/to_json_file_or_directory',
        'memory': '2g' # Allocated memory for Spark
    }
    neo4j = {
        'uri': 'bolt://localhost:7687', # Bolt instance URI
        'user': 'neo4j',
        'password': 'password'
    }
    ```

5. Running `main.py` will populate the Neo4j Graph Database with the discovered user
network :

    ```shell
    python3 main.py
    ```
